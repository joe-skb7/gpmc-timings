Description
===========

Console application for dealing with GPMC timings.
Designed for DRA7xx and OMAP-based SoCs.

Features:
 - parsing CONFIG1..CONFIG6 registers and print timings
 - converting timings (specified in text file) to register values


Examples
========

Decode register values:

    $ ./gpmc-timings -p 0x00001010 0x001e1e01 0x00090907 0x0f071d0b 0x001c1f1f \
                        0x8f070080

See doc/timings.txt for more example values.

Also you can store the output to file, and then encode those decoded values
back to register values. It can be helpful in case you want to change some
register values in human readable format, and then obtain corresponding
registers to write to device. Example:

    $ ./gpmc-timings -p 0x00001010 0x001e1e01 0x00090907 0x0f071d0b 0x001c1f1f \
                        0x8f070080 >decoded.txt

    // modify some values in file (human-readable values)

    $ ./gpmc-timings -y decoded.txt

After executing the last command you'll see all CONFIG* registers values,
generated from values in the file.
